# Explore Chigaco Bikeshare Data
This is the first project of Udacity's course called Machine Learning & AI Foundations Nanodegree Program. 
>In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also create some important functions and plot charts.

## Description
Based on the following bike system,
>Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

we have to explore the data provided to answer some quetions. 

## The Questions
You will write code to complete the following tasks:

* Task 1: Print the first 20 samples(rows) from the database
* Task 2: Print the gender(column) of the first 20 samples
* Task 3: Create a function to get the columns as a list
* Task 4: Count how many of each gender do we have
* Task 5: Create a function to count the genders
* Task 6: Show the most popular gender
* Task 7: Plot a a chart using the previous data
* Task 8: Answer why summing the number of Males and Females doesn't match the number of samples
* Task 9: Find the minimum, maximum, mean and median duration of the trips
* Task 10: Get all the start stations of the dataset
* Task 11: Create a function count the occurrence of any given column (optional)

## Where Does the Data Come From?

The data comes from a company called [Motivative](https://www.motivateco.com) and it's full Chicago's data can be found [here](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)!
